      "**Water availability in the Colorado River Basin** has declined substantially from 1980 to 2020. Here’s a summary of the key changes and causes:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Declining River Flow**\n",
      "- **Total Flow:** Average annual flows of the Colorado River measured at Lee Ferry have **decreased by about 20% since 2000**, compared to the 20th-century average.\n",
      "- **1980s:** Flows were closer to historic averages (~15 million acre-feet [MAF] per year).\n",
      "- **2000–2020:** Flows often fell below 12-13 MAF, with especially pronounced drought conditions after 2000.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Drought and \"Megadrought\"**\n",
      "- **2000–2020:** Marked the most persistent and severe drought in the region in over 1,200 years (source: Williams et al., 2022, *Nature Climate Change*).\n",
      "- **Cause:** Below-average precipitation, increased temperatures, and higher evaporation have intensified the drought.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Reservoir Storage**\n",
      "- **Lake Mead and Lake Powell:** These two key reservoirs have seen their storage levels **drop to historic lows**.\n",
      "    - **1980:** Reservoirs were mostly full, with ample carryover storage.\n",
      "    - **2020:** Combined storage less than 50% of capacity, threatening water supply and hydropower.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Water Demand and Use**\n",
      "- **Increasing demand:** Population growth in the Southwest and agricultural use kept demand high, despite modest conservation efforts.\n",
      "- **More withdrawals:** 1980–2020 saw growing use by Southern California, Arizona, Nevada, and Mexico.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Climate Change Impact**\n",
      "- Warming temperatures across the basin have led to:\n",
      "    - Less snowfall and faster snowmelt.\n",
      "    - Higher evaporation.\n",
      "    - Lower runoff into the river.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**In Summary:**  \n",
      "From 1980 to 2020, water availability in the Colorado River Basin **declined significantly**, driven by reduced river flows, increased temperatures and evaporation, ongoing drought, and steadily rising water demands.\n",

      "### **1. Nitrate (a form of nitrogen)**\n",
      "- **Nitrate concentrations have generally increased or remained high** in many major U.S. rivers, especially in the Midwest and Mississippi River Basin.  \n",
      "- **Key drivers:** Continued fertilizer use, tile drainage in agriculture, and legacy effects of decades of nutrient buildup in soils.\n",

      "### **2. Phosphorus**\n",
      "- **Phosphorus levels show mixed trends.** Some rivers, especially those near upgraded sewage treatment plants, have seen **reductions** in phosphorus concentrations, thanks to targeted regulatory and technological efforts.\n",
      "- However, in agricultural regions, **phosphorus levels remain high** due to runoff from fields and animal operations.\n",
