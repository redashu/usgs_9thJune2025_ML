      "## **Key Morphologic Changes on Sandy Coastlines Induced by Hurricanes**\n",
      "\n",
      "### **1. Beach Erosion**\n",
      "- **Storm Surge and Large Waves**: Hurricanes bring high-energy waves and elevated water levels (storm surge). The resulting flows erode the berm and foreshore, causing the **beach face to retreat landward**.\n",
      "- **Dune Erosion**: Overwash and direct wave attack can erode coastal dunes, reducing their height and volume, sometimes flattening them or creating scarped (steep) dune faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **2. Overwash and Deposition**\n",
      "- Sand is moved landward over the berm and dune, creating **overwash fans** and depositing sand across back-barrier environments (e.g., washover terraces, overwash lobes).\n",
      "- This process can **broaden barrier islands** and infill lagoons.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **3. Breaching and Inlet Formation**\n",
      "- In areas of low elevation or poorly vegetated dunes, hurricanes can breach the barrier, forming **temporary or permanent inlets**.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **4. Shoreface and Offshore Sediment Transport**\n",
      "- Sand is moved from the beach and dunes to the **nearshore bar system**, sometimes resulting in the growth of submarine sandbars and a lowering of the visible beach.\n",
      "- The **profile of the beach flattens** as sediment is taken offshore.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **5. Recovery Phase**\n",
      "- After the storm, **natural recovery processes** (fair-weather waves, wind) gradually rebuild the berm, dunes, and restore beach profiles over weeks to months.\n",

      "- **Storm Impact Scale (Sallenger 2000)**: Predicts response based on storm intensity and coastal geomorphology (swash, collision, overwash, and inundation regimes).  \n",
      "    - Small storms: minor erosion (swash).\n",
      "    - Moderate storms: dune toe erosion (collision).\n",
      "    - Strong storms: significant overwash and landward transport (overwash).\n",
      "    - Extreme storms: total inundation and landward deposition (inundation).\n",
      "\n",
      "### **B. Numerical Models**\n",
      "- **Models like XBeach, SBEACH, Delft3D:** Simulate the combined effects of waves, surge, and sediment transport to predict quantitative change (beach profiles, dune loss, overwash extents).\n",
      "    - Require high-resolution data on topography, storm parameters, sediment properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **C. Historical/Empirical Data**\n",
      "- **Studies of past storms** (remote sensing, lidar, aerial photography) provide benchmarks for expected impacts.\n",
