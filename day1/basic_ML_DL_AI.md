# Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)

## 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
**Definition**: AI is the broadest concept, referring to machines or systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, problem-solving, understanding language, and perception.

**Scope**: Includes rule-based systems, expert systems, robotics, NLP, and more.

**Examples**:
- Chatbots (like ChatGPT)
- Self-driving cars
- Game-playing AI (like AlphaGo)
- Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa)

---

## 2. Machine Learning (ML)
**Definition**: A subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every rule.

**Key Features**:
- Uses statistical techniques.
- Requires feature engineering (manual extraction of relevant data attributes).
- Works well with structured data.

**Examples**:
- Spam detection in emails
- Credit scoring in banking
- Recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon)

---

## 3. Deep Learning (DL)
**Definition**: A specialized subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to automatically learn hierarchical representations from raw data.

**Key Features**:
- Works best with unstructured data (images, audio, text).
- Requires large amounts of data and computational power (GPUs/TPUs).
- Performs automatic feature extraction (no manual engineering needed).

**Examples**:
- Image recognition (e.g., facial recognition)
- Speech-to-text (e.g., Google Assistant)
- Generative AI (e.g., DALL·E, Midjourney)
